   I am a BS student in computer science at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). I am completing my undergraduate research thesis under the supervision of Dr.Fareed Zaffar(LUMS).
</p>

### Research Interests


<p style="font-size:13pt">
   My research interests lie in internet measurements, network security and privacy challenges. My research focuses on measuring privacy threats to network-based applications and exploring security-based issues sing machine learning and quantitative analytic techniques like web mining. I am also interested in designing systems that can detect violations of data protection regulations and control the misuse of information to secure privacy in cyberspace. I hope to identify the emerging issues in online platforms and solve them by a better understanding of such risks.
