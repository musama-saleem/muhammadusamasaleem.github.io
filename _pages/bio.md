### About me

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:11pt">
   I am a BS student in computer science at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). I am completing my undergraduate research thesis under the supervision of Dr.Fareed Zaffar(LUMS).My primary research interests lie in network security and privacy challenges. My research focuses on measuring privacy threats to network-based applications and exploring security-based issues. I am interested in designing systems that can detect and control the misuse of information to secure privacy in cyberspace.
