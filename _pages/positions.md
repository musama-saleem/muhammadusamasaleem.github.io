### Project on Classification, and Evasion of Encrypted Traffic Fingerprinting

<p style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">
   I designed a system for real-time android apps classification by fingerprinting the encrypted network traffic under the supervision of Dr.Fareed Zaffar(LUMS). I am also designing robust defenses by obfuscation of network traffic so adversaries cannot fingerprint apps.

### Project on investigating the compliance with COPPA in browser-based games
<p style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">
   I investigated the compliance of gaming websites with COPPA advised by Dr.Fareed(LUMS).

### Project on counter deepfake misinformation among the low digital literacy population

<p style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">
   Our studied focused on minimizing the spread of misinformation in low digital-literacy population by countering deepfakes with Dr.Agha Ali Raza(LUMS).

##  Co-Researcher at Data Analytics Lab LUMS
### June 2019 - August 2019
### Project on recommender system based on enhanced ripple-net algorithm
 
<p style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">
   I improved a recommender system by combing the knowledge of collaborative filtering and knowledge graph advised by Dr.Imdadullah Khan(LUMS). I introduced non-uniform sampling, and explored more in depth effective rated items that increased 3.0% accuracy and AUC over an existing state of the art method.
